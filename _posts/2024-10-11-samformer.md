## <a id="goal"></a>Goal üöÄ
> Fear not, those who delved into the maths of the kernel trick, for its advent in deep learning is coming.

In this blog post, we focus on ***SAMformer***, a transformer-based architecture for time series forecasting proposed in [*SAMformer: Unlocking the Potential of Transformers in Time Series Forecasting with Sharpness-Aware Minimization and Channel-Wise Attention*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10198) <d-cite key="mairal2016endtoend"></d-cite>. SAMformer combines Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) <d-cite key="mairal2016endtoend"></d-cite> and channel-wise attention to obtain a light-weight SOTA model with improved robustness and signal propagation compared to its competitors. CKN opened a new line of research in deep learning by demonstrating the benefits of the kernel trick for deep convolutional representations. This blog aims to provide a high-level view of the CKN architecture while explaining how to implement it from scratch without relying on modern deep-learning frameworks. For a more complete picture from the mathematical side, we invite the reader to refer to the original paper

## Trainability Issues due to the Attention üîé
Before diving into the CKN itself, we briefly recall what the *kernel trick* stands for. TODO

$$
\begin{equation*}
K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}') = \langle \varphi(\mathbf{x}), \varphi(\mathbf{x}')\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}
\end{equation*}
$$

## SAMformer in-depth ‚öîÔ∏è
Now that everyone has a clear head regarding the kernel trick, we are prepared to introduce the so-called ***Convolutional Kernel Network***. The main idea behind the CKN is to leverage the kernel trick to represent local neighborhoods of images. In this section, we explain how the authors build Convolutional Kernel layers that can be stacked into a multi-layer CKN.

### Motivation: representing local image neighborhoods
The CKN architecture is a type of convolutional neural network that couples the prediction task with representation learning.

## Getting your hands dirty üñ•Ô∏è
In this section, we discuss the implementation of SAMformer. 

### Overview
The original implementation of the SAMformer architecture makes use of modern deep learning frameworks such as `PyTorch` or `TensorFlow` and can be found [here](https://github.com/romilbert/samformer).

### Main Components
We provide below the main command lines of the (PyTorch) implementation of SAMformer:
- RevIN normalizationon
- Channel-wise attention
- Residual connection
- Linear forecasting
- RevIN denormalization

## <a id="goal"></a>Goal üöÄ
> When a rigorous scientific method leads to an efficient implementation.

In this blog post, we focus on **SAMformer***, a transformer-based architecture for time series forecasting proposed in [*SAMformer: Unlocking the Potential of Transformers in Time Series Forecasting*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10198) <d-cite key="pmlr-v235-ilbert24a"></d-cite>. SAMformer combines Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) <d-cite key="foret2021sharpnessaware"></d-cite> and channel-wise attention to obtain a light-weight SOTA model with improved robustness and signal propagation compared to its competitors. This blog aims to provide a high-level view of the motivation behind SAMformer while explaining how to implement it. For the reader interested in more mathematical details or to play with SAMformer, the paper is on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10198), and the code can be found on [github](https://github.com/romilbert/samformer).

1) Problem: transformers nuls en TS forecasting + very complicated and large-scale models --> hard to identify the failure.
2) We simplify transformer to only keep the key components
3) Problem identification: trainability issues
4) Possible solution: sigma reparam or SAM
5) SAM works --> putting evertyhing together

## Motivation üîé
"On va droit au but, allez voir le papier pour plus de detail." (TO DO, something like "We'll keep it concise, refer to the paper for more details."). 
Proposition : Traditional transformer models for time series forecasting are often complex and large, making it difficult to pinpoint and address their weaknesses. SAMformer addresses this by streamlining the architecture to include only essential components, enhancing simplicity without compromising performance. Trainability issues are identified during this simplification and are tackled using Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which proved highly effective. By integrating SAM with channel-wise attention, SAMformer achieves state-of-the-art performance with a lightweight and robust design, making it a superior choice for time series forecasting.

Time series forecasting has many applications in real-world scenarios, e.g., to anticipate cardiac arrhythmia in ECG signals, predict electricity consumption to match future demand, or forecast stock market prices (an exciting topic in times of inflation). This is notoriously challenging, especially in multivariate and long-term settings, due to feature correlations and long-term temporal dependencies in time series. Moreover, Zeng et al. recently showed that, despite their success in NLP and Computer Vision, transformers were not effective on this task <d-cite key="zeng2022transformerseffectivetimeseries"></d-cite>. More specifically, they showed that the claimed SOTA transformers could be beaten by simpler and smaller methods such as linear models. 

Since traditional transformer models for time series forecasting are often complex and large, making it difficult to pinpoint and address their weaknesses.

## SAMformer ‚öîÔ∏è

### Trainability Issues of the Attention
To identify the problem, we simplify the original Transformer <d-cite key="vaswani2017"></d-cite> to only keep the key components.

### SAM to the rescue
There are two possible solutions:
- $\sigma$-reparam <d-cite key="zhai2023sigmareparam"></d-cite>:
- SAM <d-cite key="foret2021sharpnessaware"></d-cite>:

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/blog_samformer/toy_exp_losses_val_all_methods.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-0" zoomable=true %}

### Putting Everything Together
Now it works on our toy example: congrats you can now solve linear regression tasks. Hum, what about true time series data? We are only one step away from the optimal architecture: add revin <d-cite key="kim2022reversible"></d-cite>

In the end, SAMformer consists of 5 layers: RevIN normalization, channel-wise attention, residual connection, linear forecasting, and RevIN denormalization. And we are SOTA:

## Getting your hands dirty üñ•Ô∏è
In this section, we discuss the implementation of SAMformer. 

### Overview
The original implementation of the SAMformer architecture makes use of modern deep learning frameworks such as `PyTorch` or `TensorFlow` and can be found [here](https://github.com/romilbert/samformer).

### Main Components
As can be seen below, SAMformer consists of 5 layers:

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/blog_samformer/samformer_arch.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-0" zoomable=true %}

It leads to a shallow transformer with a single head and a single encoder that can be trained with SAM <d-cite key="foret2021sharpnessaware"></d-cite>. 

We provide a snippet of SAMformer (few) code lines below for the interested reader. 

{% details SAMformer Implementation %}
```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SAMFormerArchitecture(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_channels, seq_len, hid_dim, pred_horizon):
        super().__init__()
        self.revin = RevIN(num_features=num_channels)
        self.compute_keys = nn.Linear(seq_len, hid_dim)
        self.compute_queries = nn.Linear(seq_len, hid_dim)
        self.compute_values = nn.Linear(seq_len, seq_len)
        self.linear_forecaster = nn.Linear(seq_len, pred_horizon)

    def forward(self, x):

        # RevIN Normalization
        x_norm = self.revin(x.transpose(1, 2), mode='norm') 
        x_norm = x_norm.transpose(1, 2) # (n, D, L)

        # Channel-Wise Attention
        queries = self.compute_queries(x_norm) # (n, D, hid_dim)
        keys = self.compute_keys(x_norm) # (n, D, hid_dim)
        values = self.compute_values(x_norm) # (n, D, L)
        att_score = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(queries, keys, values) # (n, D, L)

        # Residual Connection
        out = x_norm + att_score # (n, D, L)

        # Linear Forecasting
        out = self.linear_forecaster(out) # (n, D, H)

        # RevIN Denormalization
        out = self.revin(out.transpose(1, 2), mode='denorm')
        out = out.transpose(1, 2) # (n, D, H)

        return out
```

## Future Work
Sigma reparam bla bla (citer Sinkformer <d-cite key="pmlr-v151-sander22a"></d-cite> + rank and signal propagation work on attention (attention is not all u need + signal propagation in transformer).
